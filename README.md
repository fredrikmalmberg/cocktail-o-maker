Cocktail-o-Maker is a web application built as part of the Interaction Programming course (DH2642) at KTH. It uses the Vue framework, Pinia for local storage and Firebase as backend and hosting.

The users can create an account and are then able to add drinks to a favorite list as well as ingredients they have on hand.
It is a site designed for the ones who want to make the most of what they have, since users will be able to list the
ingredients that they have at home and find cocktails matching those ingredients.

The app uses the CocktailDB API, which provides data of the cocktails such as the ingredients, measures, a picture etc.
